       By default, getopt() permutes the contents of argv as it scans,
       so that eventually all the nonoptions are at the end.  Two other
       scanning modes are also implemented.  If the first character of
       optstring is '+' or the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is
       set, then option processing stops as soon as a nonoption argument
       is encountered.  If '+' is not the first character of optstring,
       it is treated as a normal option.  If POSIXLY_CORRECT behaviour
       is required in this case optstring will contain two '+' symbols.
       If the first character of optstring is '-', then each nonoption
       argv-element is handled as if it were the argument of an option
       with character code 1.  (This is used by programs that were
       written to expect options and other argv-elements in any order
       and that care about the ordering of the two.)  The special
       argument "--" forces an end of option-scanning regardless of the
       scanning mode
